Hear the sound of the falling 
rainComing down like an Armageddon 
flame (HEY!)The shame, the ones 
who died without a nameHear 
the dogs howling out of 
keyTo a hymn called "Faith 
and Misery" (Hey!)And bleed, the 
company lost the war todayI 
beg to dream and differ 
from the hollow liesThis is 
the dawning of the rest 
of our livesOn holidayHear the 
drum pounding out of timeAnother 
protestor has crossed the line 
(HEY!)To find, the money's on 
the other sideCan I get 
another Amen (AMEN!)There's a flag 
wrapped around a score of 
men (HEY!)A gag, A plastic 
bag on a monumentI beg 
to dream and differ from 
the hollow liesThis is the 
dawning of the rest of 
our livesOn holidayThe representative from 
California has the floorZieg Heil 
to the president gasmanBombs away 
is your punishmentPulverize the Eiffel 
towersWho criticize your governmentBang bang 
goes the broken glassKill all 
the fags that don't agreeTrials 
by fire, setting fireIs not 
a way that's meant for 
meJust cause...(hey, hey)Just cause, because 
we're outlaws YEAH!I beg to 
dream and differ from the 
hollow liesThis is the dawning 
of the rest of our 
livesI beg to dream and
